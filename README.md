    -   Place your avatar image (e.g., `avatar.jpg`) inside the `/public/images/` folder.
    -   Update the `avatar` field in the `data` object: `avatar: "/images/avatar.jpg"`.
    -   Place your publication images (e.g., `pub1.png`) in the same `/public/images/` folder and update the `image` field for each publication.

3.  **CV PDF File**:
    -   Place your PDF file (e.g., `Jiaxi_Yu_CV.pdf`) inside the `/public/cv/` folder.
    -   Update the `cvHref` field in the `data` object: `cvHref: "/cv/Jiaxi_Yu_CV.pdf"`.
